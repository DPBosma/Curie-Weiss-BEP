# Curie-Weiss-BEP

Julia code corresponding to the Bachelor End Project of Douwe Bosma.

These files form the package that is used to estimate parameters of the Curie-Weiss model. The method used in this pakage is Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation.

FILES:
Curie-WeissModelFunction:   This file contains all functions of the package.
Curie-WeissModelMain:       This file is the main file of the program.
Plotfunction:               This program file creates figures of 2 by 3 diagram that is found in the report.
Plotfunction3:              This progam crates figures of two or tree diagrams that can be found in the report.
